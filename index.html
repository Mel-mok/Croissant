    <h1>World's best Croissants Bakery</h1>
    <p>
      Known in France as croissants de boulanger, this yeasted dough is layered
      with butter and given a succession of folds that create the distinctive
      profile of classic croissants. Light and airy and shatteringly crisp, with
      a deeply caramelized buttery flavor, these croissants are a labor of love
      that's absolutely worth the time.
